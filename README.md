## What is Rezible?

Rezible is an "operations intelligence layer" for large-scale software systems. 
It provides opinionated tooling for humans and agents to operate the code they write in production. 
While doing so it aims to build a holistic understanding of the system & make it available as needed to human or AI. 

### Current Status
Rezible is currently under heavy development, with no stable release available.

In the meantime please feel free to leave feedback, requests, or suggestions as GitHub issues!
